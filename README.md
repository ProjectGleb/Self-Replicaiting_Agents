# T-1000: Self-Replicating LLM Agent Swarms.
---
Goal: in this paper I intend to investigate how dynamic language swarms compare to solid state swarms in completing open ended tasks.

To summarize, my contributions are the following:
•	I propose T-1000, a new paradigm in agent architecture that allows for the dynamic design of hierarchical swarms over a combinatorial space of possible reasoning and acting steps.
•	In the paper I will explore this emergent property of managing LLM agents and empirically show that liquid structures are ether extremely useful or useless at executing complex tasks without any prior trials.  
•	I introduce SRSGym, an agent swarm benchmarking gym environment consisting of 40 benchmarks from Leetcode questions (‘hard-level‘ in 19 programming languages) to real world multi-step action tasks. 
•	I will atempt to show wether T-1000 achieves improvements over strong baselines across several tasks, and wether it achieves state-of-the-art results on various benchmarks.
